Test to re-analyze the FOC currents while I am holding the motor still


trial1:
    command: 0.5A
    
    motor.PID_current_q.P = .01;
    motor.PID_current_q.I= 50;
    motor.PID_current_d.P= .01;
    motor.PID_current_d.I = 50;
    motor.LPF_current_q.Tf = 0.01; 
    motor.LPF_current_d.Tf = 0.01; 

    observations:
    - i could not stop it from spinning, when I did, then there would be no torque. it was like the poles were misaligned or something

trial2:
    try lowering the q gain
    
    motor.PID_current_q.P = .01;
    motor.PID_current_q.I= 50;
    motor.PID_current_d.P= .01;
    motor.PID_current_d.I = 300;
    motor.LPF_current_q.Tf = 0.01; 
    motor.LPF_current_d.Tf = 0.01;
