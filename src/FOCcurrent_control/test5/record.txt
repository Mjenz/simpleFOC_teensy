TEST 5: SimpleFOC setup with Teensy 4.0 using Salee Logic Analyzer and python script to read from serial

trial 1: simplefoc current control, reading from two pins on teensy with only ADC
    saw good results, will compare with logic analyzer

trial 2: sampled with both, to compare. 
    run time: 1.5s
    Logic analyzer sampling rate: 31.25kS/s
    ADC: 10000 samples --> 6.666 kS/s
    SKIP current sense align

    observations:
    - the signals match well!
    - there is a small difference in scope vs. the adc output, adc is lower in magnitude

trial 3: try this time without specifying the phase to phase resistance
    run time: 1.5s
    Logic analyzer sampling rate: 31.25kS/s
    ADC: 10000 samples --> 6.666 kS/s
    SKIP current sense align


    observations:
    - there is still the voltage difference
    - not specifying phase resistance didn't have meaningful effect


trial 4: use the ADC on teensy while turning the motor by hand
    ADC: 6.666 kSa/s
    logic analyzer: 31.25kSa/s

    observations:
    - no voltage difference, higher resolution
    - does not record negative voltages, there is no offset
    
    offsets:
    ia:0.120253
    ib:0.122848

trial 5: set the current offsets to zero in simpleFOC and test using both ADC (in simpleFOC mode) and the scope
    ADC: 6.666 kSa/s
    logic analyzer: 31.25kSa/s

    observations:
    - voltages now match!
